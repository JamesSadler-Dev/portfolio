            <br>My favorite projects are anything interactive, such as web dev.
            <br>Something cool about me is: I practiced everyday for 5000+ hrs.

                    <p>Loop Objects, execute part of the loop and come back to it later.
                        You can use an asynchronous function to make even more compelling possibilties of loop objects,
                        the new possibilities this enables are exciting.

                    <p>On this day, I have crossed the mark of 5000 hours of learning and practicing programming. I practiced eight hours everyday without a day off for 18 months straight to accomplish this challenge!
                    Thank you to everyone who's support made this goal possible.
